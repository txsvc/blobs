# Overview  
The blobs library and CLI provides a unified interface for storing, retrieving, and managing large binary objects (blobs) across multiple cloud storage providers. 
It integrates with the txsvc ecosystem (stdlib, cloudlib, apikit) to provide enterprise-grade blob storage capabilities with consistent APIs, 
authentication, and monitoring. The library solves the problem of vendor lock-in and provides abstraction over different cloud storage services 
while maintaining performance and reliability.

# Core Features  
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Seamless integration with major cloud storage providers (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface regardless of underlying storage provider
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for direct blob operations and management
- **Authentication Integration**: Leverages existing auth patterns from apikit and cloudlib
- **Streaming Support**: Efficient handling of large files through streaming upload/download
- **Metadata Management**: Rich metadata support for blobs including content type, tags, and custom attributes
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in observability using cloudlib's observer patterns
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration using stdlib's settings patterns

# User Experience  
- **Developers**: Use the Go library to integrate blob storage into their applications
- **DevOps/SysAdmins**: Use the CLI for operational tasks and automation
- **API Users**: Interact with blobs through RESTful APIs when integrated with apikit
- Key user flows include: upload/download operations, listing and searching blobs, managing metadata, and monitoring storage usage

# Technical Architecture  
- **Core Library**: Go package with provider-agnostic interfaces
- **Provider Implementations**: Separate packages for each cloud provider (Google, AWS, Azure)
- **CLI Component**: Command-line tool built on top of the core library
- **Configuration**: JSON/YAML configuration files with environment variable support
- **Authentication**: Integration with cloudlib auth patterns and provider-specific credentials
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract interface defining common operations (Put, Get, Delete, List, Exists)
- **Metadata Store**: Optional local or cloud-based metadata indexing for search capabilities
- **Streaming Support**: io.Reader/Writer interfaces for efficient large file handling

# Development Roadmap  
**Phase 1 - Core Foundation**
- Project structure and build system
- Core interfaces and types definition
- Configuration management using stdlib patterns
- Basic local file system provider for testing

**Phase 2 - Google Cloud Storage Provider**
- Google Cloud Storage implementation
- Authentication integration with cloudlib
- Basic CLI commands (upload, download, list)
- Comprehensive testing suite

**Phase 3 - Additional Providers**
- AWS S3 provider implementation
- Azure Blob Storage provider implementation
- Provider selection and configuration

**Phase 4 - Advanced Features**
- Metadata management and search
- Streaming optimizations
- Progress reporting and resumable uploads
- Integration with cloudlib observer for monitoring

**Phase 5 - CLI Enhancement**
- Advanced CLI commands and flags
- Batch operations
- Interactive mode
- Shell completion

**Phase 6 - Integration & Polish**
- apikit integration for REST API
- Documentation and examples
- Performance optimizations
- Production readiness

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation First**: Core interfaces, types, and configuration must be established before any provider implementations
2. **Single Provider MVP**: Complete Google Cloud Storage implementation provides working system that can be tested and validated
3. **CLI Basics**: Simple CLI operations on top of core library prove the abstraction works
4. **Provider Expansion**: Additional providers validate the interface design
5. **Feature Enhancement**: Advanced features build upon solid foundation
6. **Integration**: apikit and advanced CLI features require stable core

# Risks and Mitigations  
**Technical Challenges:**
- Provider API differences: Mitigate with thorough interface design and provider-specific adapters
- Large file handling: Use streaming interfaces and chunked operations
- Authentication complexity: Leverage existing cloudlib patterns

**MVP Definition:**
- Core library with Google Cloud Storage provider
- Basic CLI with upload/download/list operations
- Configuration management
- This provides immediate value and can be built upon incrementally

**Resource Constraints:**
- Focus on single provider initially
- Reuse patterns from existing txsvc libraries
- Prioritize essential features over nice-to-haves

# Appendix  
**Technical Specifications:**
- Go 1.21+ compatibility
- Integration with existing txsvc module patterns
- Cloud provider SDK dependencies
- CLI built with standard flag package or cobra
- Testing with real cloud storage accounts in CI/CD

**Research Findings:**
- Google Cloud Storage provides most comprehensive Go SDK
- AWS S3 has broadest adoption and compatibility
- Azure Blob Storage offers competitive pricing
- All major providers support similar core operations
